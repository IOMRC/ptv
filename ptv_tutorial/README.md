The manual consists of two main chapters:

1) design of PTV experimental setup
2) using the PTV software Streams
  * a) Quick start (detailed)
 
  * b) Quick start (summary and example)


'Quick start detailed' is for users who have obtained images on their own, and want to convert these images into velocity fields. The steps are detailed and include tips and recommendation as experienced by the author. The description does not present the full functionality of the software, and any student using the description is advised to go through the official Streams manual as well.

'Quick start summary and example' is a brief overview of the software including an example. The images are attached in the folder, as wll as the 'Dual Threshold PID', the 'PTVanalysis pipeline' and the 'Velocity_Field' file. The user does not need to create any new files, simply follow the steps in the summary figure. Note that mm/pix=0.18 and time step is 0.0667.
